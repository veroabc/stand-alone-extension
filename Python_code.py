### In this pythonyÃ© code we will create an application for calculating the fare for the rental operations.
### Our goals are:
* Application can calculate the fare of rented e-scooters according to usage time or usage distance.
* Application is controlled via the console.
* Users can make inputs via the console.
* Outputs are returned via the console.
* GUI is not required

#if the customer has no input. We will use variable no_valid_input

no_valid_input = 'No valid input received. Please try again.'

# Defining a function for a common information like main
